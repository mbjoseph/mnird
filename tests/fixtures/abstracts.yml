        and mapping using field-based training data, high spatial resolution airborne
        hyperspectral imagery, and a convolutional neural network classifier (CNN).
        We tested our methods by identifying seven dominant trees species as well
        as dead standing trees in a mixed-conifer forest in the Southern Sierra Nevada
        Mountains, CA (USA) using training, validation, and testing datasets composed
        of spatially-explicit transects and plots sampled across a single strip of
        imaging spectroscopy. We also used a three-band \u2018Red-Green-Blue\u2019
        pseudo true-color subset of the hyperspectral imagery strip to test the classification
        accuracy of a CNN model without the additional non-visible spectral data provided
        in the hyperspectral imagery. Our classifier is pixel-based rather than object
        based, although we use three-dimensional structural information from airborne
        Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to identify trees (points &gt; 5 m above
        the ground) and the classifier was applied to image pixels that were thus
        identified as tree crowns. By training a CNN classifier using field data and
        hyperspectral imagery, we were able to accurately identify tree species and
        predict their distribution, as well as the distribution of tree mortality,
        across the landscape. Using a window size of 15 pixels and eight hidden convolutional
        layers, a CNN model classified the correct species of 713 individual trees
        from hyperspectral imagery with an average F-score of 0.87 and F-scores ranging
        from 0.67\u20130.95 depending on species. The CNN classification model performance
        increased from a combined F-score of 0.64 for the Red-Green-Blue model to
        a combined F-score of 0.87 for the hyperspectral model. The hyperspectral
        CNN model captures the species composition changes across ~700 meters (1935
        to 2630 m) of elevation from a lower-elevation mixed oak conifer forest to
        a higher-elevation fir-dominated coniferous forest. High resolution tree species
        maps can support forest ecosystem monitoring and management, and identifying
        dead trees aids landscape assessment of forest mortality resulting from drought,
        insects and pathogens. We publicly provide our code to apply deep learning
        classifiers to tree species identification from geospatial imagery and field
        training data.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/rs11192326","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,7]],"date-time":"2019-10-07T07:34:01Z","timestamp":1570433641000},"page":"2326","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["A

        accelerate scientific progress on remote tree classification\u2014as well

        and Technology created a community-based competition where scientists were
        invited to contribute informatics methods for classifying tree species and
        genus using crown-level images of trees. We classified tree species and genus
        at the pixel level using hyperspectral and LiDAR observations. We compared
        three algorithms that have been implemented extensively across a broad range
        of research applications: support vector machines, random forests, and multilayer
        perceptron. At the pixel level, the multilayer perceptron algorithm classified
        species or genus with high accuracy (92.7% and 95.9%, respectively) on the
        training data and performed better than the other two algorithms (85.8\u201393.5%).
        This indicates promise for the use of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm
        for tree-species classification based on hyperspectral and LiDAR observations
        and coincides with a growing body of research in which neural network-based
        algorithms outperform other types of classification algorithm for machine
        vision. To aggregate patterns across the images, we used an ensemble approach
        that averages the pixel-level outputs of the MLP algorithm to classify species
        at the crown level. The average accuracy of these classifications on the test
        set was 68.8% for the nine species.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.6101","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,28]],"date-time":"2019-02-28T09:31:35Z","timestamp":1551346295000},"page":"e6101","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Remote

        has reached the point where data science competitions, in which multiple groups
        solve the same problem using the same data by different methods, will be productive
        for advancing quantitative methods for tasks such as species identification
        from remote sensing images. We ran a competition to help improve three tasks
        that are central to converting images into information on individual trees:
        (1) crown segmentation, for identifying the location and size of individual
        trees; (2) alignment, to match ground truthed trees with remote sensing; and
        (3) species classification of individual trees. Six teams (composed of 16
        individual participants) submitted predictions for one or more tasks. The
        crown segmentation task proved to be the most challenging, with the highest-performing
        algorithm yielding only 34% overlap between remotely sensed crowns and the
        ground truthed trees. However, most algorithms performed better on large trees.
        For the alignment task, an algorithm based on minimizing the difference, in
        terms of both position and tree size, between ground truthed and remotely
        sensed crowns yielded a perfect alignment. In hindsight, this task was over
        simplified by only including targeted trees instead of all possible remotely
        sensed crowns. Several algorithms performed well for species classification,
        with the highest-performing algorithm correctly classifying 92% of individuals
        and performing well on both common and rare species. Comparisons of results
        across algorithms provided a number of insights for improving the overall
        accuracy in extracting ecological information from remote sensing. Our experience
        suggests that this kind of competition can benefit methods development in
        ecology and biology more broadly.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.5843","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,28]],"date-time":"2019-02-28T10:12:13Z","timestamp":1551348733000},"page":"e5843","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["A

        species classification using hyperspectral imagery is a challenging task due
        to the high spectral similarity between species and large intra-species variability.
        This paper proposes a solution using the Multiple Instance Adaptive Cosine
        Estimator (MI-ACE) algorithm. MI-ACE estimates a discriminative target signature
        to differentiate between a pair of tree species while accounting for label
        uncertainty. Multi-class species classification is achieved by training a
        set of one-vs-one MI-ACE classifiers corresponding to the classification between
        each pair of tree species and a majority voting on the classification results
        from all classifiers. Additionally, the performance of MI-ACE does not rely
        on parameter settings that require tuning resulting in a method that is easy
        to use in application. Results presented are using training and testing data
        provided by a data analysis competition aimed at encouraging the development
        of methods for extracting ecological information through remote sensing obtained
        through participation in the competition. The experimental results using one-vs-one
        MI-ACE technique composed of a hierarchical classification, where a tree crown
        is first classified to one of the genus classes and one of the species classes.
        The species-level rank-1 classification accuracy is 86.4% and cross entropy
        is 0.9395 on the testing data, provided by the competition organizer, without
        the release of ground truth for testing data. Similarly, the same evaluation
        metrics are computed on the training data, where the rank-1 classification
        accuracy is 95.62% and the cross entropy is 0.2649. The results show that
        the presented approach can not only classify the majority species classes,
        but also classify the rare species classes.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.6405","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,28]],"date-time":"2019-02-28T09:30:33Z","timestamp":1551346233000},"page":"e6405","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Hyperspectral

        hyperspectral imaging is the mapping of the spatial distribution of vegetation
        biophysical and biochemical parameters in an environment. Statistical models,
        such as Gaussian processes, have been very successful for modeling vegetation
        parameters from captured spectra, however their performance is highly dependent
        on the amount of available ground truth. This is a problem because it is generally
        expensive to obtain ground truth information due to difficulties and costs
        associated with sample collection and analysis. In this paper, we present
        two Gaussian processes based approaches for improving the accuracy of vegetation
        parameter retrieval when ground truth is limited. The first is the adoption
        of covariance functions based on well-established metrics, such as, spectral
        angle and spectral correlation, which are known to be better measures of similarity
        for spectral data owing to their resilience to spectral variabilities. The
        second is the joint modeling of related vegetation parameters by multitask
        Gaussian processes so that the prediction accuracy of the vegetation parameter
        of interest can be improved with the aid of related vegetation parameters
        for which a larger set of ground truth is available. We experimentally demonstrate
        the efficacy of the proposed methods against existing approaches on three
        real-world hyperspectral datasets and one synthetic dataset.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/rs11131614","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,8]],"date-time":"2019-07-08T07:01:31Z","timestamp":1562569291000},"page":"1614","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Gaussian

        of habitat selection for many taxa, and airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and
        Ranging) technology is increasingly used to measure forest structure. Many
        studies have examined the relationship between LiDAR-derived structural characteristics
        and wildlife, but few have examined those characteristics in relation to small
        mammals, specifically, small mammal diversity. The aim of this study was to
        determine if LiDAR could predict small mammal diversity in a temperate-mixed
        forest community in Northern Wisconsin, USA, and which LiDAR-derived structural
        variables best predict small mammal diversity. We calculated grid metrics
        from LiDAR point cloud data for 17 plots in three differently managed sites
        and related the metrics to small mammal diversity calculated from five months
        of small mammal trapping data. We created linear models, then used model selection
        and multi-model inference as well as model fit metrics to determine if LiDAR-derived
        structural variables could predict small mammal diversity. We found that small
        mammal diversity could be predicted by LiDAR-derived variables including structural
        diversity, cover, and canopy complexity as well as site (as a proxy for management).
        Structural diversity and canopy complexity were positively related with small
        mammal diversity, while cover was negatively related to small mammal diversity.
        Although this study was conducted in a single habitat type during a single
        season, it demonstrates that LiDAR can be used to predict small mammal diversity
        in this location and possibly can be expanded to predict small mammal diversity
        across larger spatial scales.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/rs11192222","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,25]],"date-time":"2019-09-25T07:51:18Z","timestamp":1569397878000},"page":"2222","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Lidar

        assess how species distributions and abundances affect the structure, function,
        and composition of ecosystems. Yet we face a major challenge: it is difficult
        to precisely map species across landscapes. Novel Earth observations could
        overcome this challenge for vegetation mapping. Airborne imaging spectrometers
        measure plant functional traits at high resolution, and these measurements
        can be used to identify tree species. In this paper, I describe a trait-based
        approach to species identification with imaging spectroscopy, the Center for
        Conservation Biology species identification (CCB-ID) method, which was developed
        as part of an ecological data science evaluation competition.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>These
        methods were developed using airborne imaging spectroscopy data from the National
        Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). CCB-ID classified tree species using
        trait-based reflectance variation and decision tree-based machine learning
        models, approximating a morphological trait and dichotomous key method inspired
        by botanical classification. First, outliers were removed using a spectral
        variance threshold. The remaining samples were transformed using principal
        components analysis (PCA) and resampled to reduce common species biases. Gradient
        boosting and random forest classifiers were trained using the transformed
        and resampled feature data. Prediction probabilities were calibrated using
        sigmoid regression, and sample-scale predictions were averaged to the crown
        scale.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>CCB-ID
        received a rank-1 accuracy score of 0.919, and a cross-entropy cost score
        of 0.447 on the competition test data. Accuracy and specificity scores were
        high for all species, but precision and recall scores varied for rare species.
        PCA transformation improved accuracy scores compared to models trained using
        reflectance data, but outlier removal and data resampling exacerbated class
        imbalance problems.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Discussion<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>CCB-ID
        accurately classified tree species using NEON data, reporting the best scores
        among participants. However, it failed to overcome several species mapping
        challenges like precisely identifying rare species. Key takeaways include
        (1) selecting models using metrics beyond accuracy (e.g., recall) could improve
        rare species predictions, (2) within-genus trait variation may drive spectral
        separability, precluding efforts to distinguish between functionally convergent
        species, (3) outlier removal and data resampling can exacerbate class imbalance
        problems, and should be carefully implemented, (4) PCA transformation greatly
        improved model results, and (5) targeted feature selection could further improve
        species classification models. CCB-ID is open source, designed for use with
        NEON data, and available to support species mapping efforts.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.5666","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,8]],"date-time":"2018-10-08T08:41:31Z","timestamp":1538988091000},"page":"e5666","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The

        and cost of biodiversity and forestry surveys. Data acquisition currently
        outpaces the ability to identify individual organisms in high resolution imagery.
        We outline an approach for identifying tree-crowns in RGB imagery while using
        a semi-supervised deep learning detection network. Individual crown delineation
        has been a long-standing challenge in remote sensing and available algorithms
        produce mixed results. We show that deep learning models can leverage existing
        Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)-based unsupervised delineation to generate
        trees that are used for training an initial RGB crown detection model. Despite
        limitations in the original unsupervised detection approach, this noisy training
        data may contain information from which the neural network can learn initial
        tree features. We then refine the initial model using a small number of higher-quality
        hand-annotated RGB images. We validate our proposed approach while using an
        open-canopy site in the National Ecological Observation Network. Our results
        show that a model using 434,551 self-generated trees with the addition of
        2848 hand-annotated trees yields accurate predictions in natural landscapes.
        Using an intersection-over-union threshold of 0.5, the full model had an average
        tree crown recall of 0.69, with a precision of 0.61 for the visually-annotated
        data. The model had an average tree detection rate of 0.82 for the field collected
        stems. The addition of a small number of hand-annotated trees improved the
        performance over the initial self-supervised model. This semi-supervised deep
        learning approach demonstrates that remote sensing can overcome a lack of
        labeled training data by generating noisy data for initial training using
        unsupervised methods and retraining the resulting models with high quality
        labeled data.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/rs11111309","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,3]],"date-time":"2019-06-03T06:08:40Z","timestamp":1559542120000},"page":"1309","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Individual

        detection is a fundamental task in remote sensing for forestry and ecosystem
        ecology applications. While many individual tree segmentation algorithms have
        been proposed, the development and testing of these algorithms is typically
        site specific, with few methods evaluated against data from multiple forest
        types simultaneously. This makes it difficult to determine the generalization
        of proposed approaches, and limits tree detection at broad scales. Using data
        from the National Ecological Observatory Network we extend a recently developed
        semi-supervised deep learning algorithm to include data from a range of forest
        types, determine whether information from one forest can be used for tree
        detection in other forests, and explore the potential for building a universal
        tree detection algorithm. We find that the deep learning approach works well
        for overstory tree detection across forest conditions, outperforming conventional
        LIDAR-only methods in all forest types. Performance was best in open oak woodlands
        and worst in alpine forests. When models were fit to one forest type and used
        to predict another, performance generally decreased, with better performance
        when forests were more similar in structure. However, when models were pretrained
        on data from other sites and then fine-tuned using a small amount of hand-labeled
        data from the evaluation site, they performed similarly to local site models.
        Most importantly, a universal model fit to data from all sites simultaneously
        performed as well or better than individual models trained for each local
        site. This result suggests that RGB tree detection models that can be applied
        to a wide array of forest types at broad scales should be possible.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1101\/790071","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,10,2]],"date-time":"2019-10-02T22:05:11Z","timestamp":1570053911000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Geographic

        ecology has increasingly focused on describing ecological communities based
        on their traits (measurable features affecting individuals\u2019 fitness and
        performance). Analyzing trait distributions within and among forests could
        significantly improve understanding of community composition and ecosystem
        function. Historically, data on trait distributions in ecosystems are generated
        by (1) collecting few leaves from a small number of trees, which suffers from
        limited sampling but produces information at the fundamental ecological unit
        (the individual); or (2) using remote sensing images to infer traits, producing
        information continuously across large regions, but as plots (containing multiple
        trees of different species) or pixels, not individuals. Remote sensing methods
        that identify individual trees and estimate their traits would provide the
        benefits of both approaches, producing continuous large-scale data linked
        to biological individuals. We used data from the National Ecological Observatory
        Network (NEON) to develop a method to scale up functional traits measured
        on 160 trees to the millions of trees within the spatial extent of two NEON
        sites. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) image segmentation, to identify
        individual trees and estimate their structural traits; 2) ensemble of models
        to infer leaf mass area (LMA), nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus content using
        hyperspectral signatures; and 3) making predictions for segmented crowns for
        the full remote sensing footprint at the NEON sites.<\/jats:p><jats:p>Nitrogen,
        LMA and phosphorus models R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup> values ranged from 0.50
        to 0.75 on held out test data. The ensemble approach performed better than
        single partial least squares generalized linear regressions models. Models
        for carbon performed poorly compared to other traits (R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>
        of 0.22). Crown segmentation produced the highest uncertainty in the pipeline,
        generally due to over-segmentation. Despite this, crown traits predictions
        performed significantly better than comparable 1m<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup> pixel
        predictions, resulting in improvement of R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup> on test
        data of between 0.07 to 0.20 points.<\/jats:p><jats:p>We used the pipeline
        to produce individual level trait data for \u223c5 million individual crowns,
        covering a total extent of \u223c360 km<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>. This large
        data set allows testing ecological questions on landscapes scales, for example
        revealing leaf chemical traits were correlated with physical traits and environmental
        conditions including height and elevation.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1101\/556472","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,21]],"date-time":"2019-02-21T21:24:16Z","timestamp":1550784256000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Rethinking

        international data science challenge, called National Ecological Observatory
        Network\u2014National Institute of Standards and Technology data science evaluation,
        was set up in autumn 2017 with the goal to improve the use of remote sensing
        data in ecological applications. The competition was divided into three tasks:
        (1) individual tree crown (ITC) delineation, for identifying the location
        and size of individual trees; (2) alignment between field surveyed trees and
        ITCs delineated on remote sensing data; and (3) tree species classification.
        In this paper, the methods and results of team Fondazione Edmund Mach (FEM)
        are presented. The ITC delineation (Task 1 of the challenge) was done using
        a region growing method applied to a near-infrared band of the hyperspectral
        images. The optimization of the parameters of the delineation algorithm was
        done in a supervised way on the basis of the Jaccard score using the training
        set provided by the organizers. The alignment (Task 2) between the delineated
        ITCs and the field surveyed trees was done using the Euclidean distance among
        the position, the height, and the crown radius of the ITCs and the field surveyed
        trees. The classification (Task 3) was performed using a support vector machine
        classifier applied to a selection of the hyperspectral bands and the canopy
        height model. The selection of the bands was done using the sequential forward
        floating selection method and the Jeffries Matusita distance. The results
        of the three tasks were very promising: team FEM ranked first in the data
        science competition in Task 1 and 2, and second in Task 3. The Jaccard score
        of the delineated crowns was 0.3402, and the results showed that the proposed
        approach delineated both small and large crowns. The alignment was correctly
        done for all the test samples. The classification results were good (overall
        accuracy of 88.1%, kappa accuracy of 75.7%, and mean class accuracy of 61.5%),
        although the accuracy was biased toward the most represented species.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.6227","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,11]],"date-time":"2019-01-11T09:33:16Z","timestamp":1547199196000},"page":"e6227","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Individual
